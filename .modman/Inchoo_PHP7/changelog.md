### Added
- shell/inchoo_php7_test.php - initial implementation of a test tool 

## [1.0.7] - 2017-02-02
### Changed

### Removed
- removed XML totals sort order fix from config.xml

### Added
- topological sort implemented in Mage_Sales_Model_Config_Ordered override (this should fix not only Magento Core problems with totals sorting, but also ensure 3rd party extensions which add something to totals work properly with PHP 7.)

## [1.0.6] - 2016-09-08
### Added
